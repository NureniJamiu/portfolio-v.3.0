            <p>Hello – again. I promise you, this is gonna be a long read. </p>

            <p>
              I believe in learning things the long (often harder) way. Like
              finding the energy to have a website (or whatever this is).
              I&apos;m not 100% sure it is a wise use of my time but it feels
              right to speak my truth. I design websites because I got good
              enough to get paid for it (crazy that I get to feed my family
              doing this). I probably sound like a basic techie. Perhaps. These
              few words, and what I do everyday are the only trace of my
              existence. There is so much stuff out there. It&apos;s at best
              distracting but realistically destructive (by fragmenting our
              attention, then intellect and ultimately our society). I
              don&apos;t want this for myself, my people, and honestly, the
              world. I crave contemplation but rarely get to it. Discipline and
              self examination keep me sane (and lots of walks and bike rides).
            </p>

              I was born and raised in Nigeria, then in late 2016, Jessica Ko
              found me on dribbble and flew me to the Bay Area to join
              Opendoor&apos;s design team where I spent 5 years. In less than 6
              years I went from living out of a few bags to have a family.
              It&apos;s been wild to say the least. I never planned any of that.
              While I&apos;m filled with gratitude I want to put as much
              intention as I can to figure out where I want to live and what
              kind of life. That - takes most of my free time. I like to think
              that I practice a sort of socratic examined life; a wholesome
              summum bonum. It has been complicated for me to find much
              satisfaction in my contribution as a web designer. A website is a
              website. Yet almost ten years later I&apos;m still here, making
              websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              An odd mix work ethic and ego led me to define myself through the
              stuff I make. I like to make stuff (almost always too fast). That
              qualifies for the tech bro archetype, who needs to
              &quot;make&quot; things (often obvious mistakes) to learn.
              Unfortunately I am one of those monkeys for whom most learning
              comes from experience. As I age, I get reminded that the stuff
              that viscerally gets acknowledged rarely comes from passive
              consumption but rather from deeply engaged acts. Being a designer
              has been technical enough to make me believe I understand things
              better over time. But also abstract to keep me humble and hungry.
              Images and words are imperfect. It looks like we are just
              realizing the problem with words while we&apos;ve been aware of
              how images can distort our perception for a long time. I&apos;ll
              keep making images and code stuff, that&apos;s my way to chip away
              at life&apos;s monolith, or to push my rock up the mountain like
              Sisyphus. I spend most of my time torn between ascetic ideals and
              pragmatic coping strategies, that&apos;s my version of the
              examined life.

              After quitting social media I decided to put more intention in the
              way I use the internet in general. I used to think about things in
              terms of cost/benefit only and fell for the potential value
              without indexing the attention cost. I&apos;m now reclaiming my
              fragmented attention. The few connections, ideas, and laughs I got
              from it are not worth the space it took in my head. Of course,
              I&apos;m afraid of the social stigma and the potential effect it
              could have on my career... after all, I didn&apos;t delete my
              Linkedin account. It says something about me. Those who will
              examine my online presence will perceive this differently – be it.
              I know the design world is all up on twitter and instagram. Mostly
              for reach and interaction according to my understanding. Vanity,
              garbage, and burnout are too much for me to justify the effort of
              coping. I&apos;ll be active where relevant: Dribbble and this
              site.

              I don&apos;t think or care much about tech stack, data,
              accessibility or AI. A scary sentence to write but that is
              partially what motivated me to leave social media that seems
              obsessed with these matters. The web industry is increasingly
              fragmented and driven by highly specialized tools. This promotes a
              loss of autonomy by increasing dependencies and lack of (human)
              specialists. Too many inputs and tools have distracted me from the
              human reality of the creative process: consider context, take
              decisions, do the work and iterate. Limiting inputs narrows the
              context, it&apos;s crucial for me to stay functional. I often
              choose to center around tangibility and what I judge is the wisest
              feasible action. That may sound pretentious but it allows me to
              find meaning in what I do. Data and AI are two polarizing topics.
              I&apos;m conformably stating that: They both are tools, and they
              will be leveraged to create the usual 80-20 ratio of trash to
              goodness. Designers seem perpetually threatened by
              democratization. Tool after tool, it&apos;s the same story.
              It&apos;s absurd. My interest lies in creating stuff grounded in
              good practices that reflect my team&apos;s opinion and best
              execution while using the simplest tool to make the thing. So far
              AI has been fun but not particularly insightful and Data has been
              frustrating as its source and meaning often seem to be here to
              justify a request more than a real need.

              While I&apos;m not a technologist, I&apos;m not a monk either.
              I&apos;m way too fidgety and working on it. Modern tech devices
              really rub my monkey mind the wrong way but I get that I need to
              accept it as a part of life. So I&apos;ve been a fair-weather
              meditator for a while now. Believing that discipline was the only
              thing keeping me away from the peace and insights (silly, I know)
              I&apos;ve been practicing on and off for years. Recent ventures
              into Zen and Daoism thought have removed the goals from the
              ritual, providing just enough guidance to allow a glance of the
              feeling. A feeling, not words or any other symbols. Understanding
              the importance of the non-verbal experience of life has been
              eye-opening. So when time opens up, I sit, just to sit, relax what
              is between my eyes, and watch my posture and breath.

              They say feedback is a gift. While I don&apos;t track anything, I
              like to know how you feel about being here on my website so feel
              free to reach out. My gratitude for the opportunity to be here now
              is larger than an html file can hold. You could be anywhere — and
              yet, you are here now.
